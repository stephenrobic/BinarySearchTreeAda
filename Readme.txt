This is an implementation of a Binary Search Tree with inorder threading in Ada for a Data Structures & Algorithms class project.
It uses Ada generics to allow flexible use of different data types for future use.
The following functions are implemented: 
	-Insertion of a node (with a name and phone number, for example)
	-Deletion of a node (and proper restructuring of the BST)
	-Search by name Iterative
	-Search by name Recursively
	-Printing a Name and/or Number before deleting, after searching, or while traversing
	-Inorder Tree Traversal by Traversing each Inorder Successors Iteratively (starting from a specified node or from the head node)
	-Preorder Traversal Iterative
	-In Order Traversal Recursively
	-Post Order Traversal Iteratively
	-Post Order Traversal Recursively
